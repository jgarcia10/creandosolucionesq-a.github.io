Follow the guidelines in https://docs.github.com/contributing/writing-for-github-docs/content-model#quickstart to write this article.

The entire quickstart should be about 600 words long or take about five minutes to read.

## Introduction

{% comment %}

Build on the quick phrasing above by
- Clarifying the audience
- Clearly stating prerequisites and prior knowledge needed
- Stating what the user will accomplish or build
{% endcomment %}

## Step one: Action the user will take

{% comment %}

In one sentence, describe what the user will do in this step 
Steps should break down the tasks the user will complete in sequential order 
Avoid replicating conceptual information that is covered elsewhere, provide inline links instead. Only include conceptual information unique to this use case. 
{% endcomment %}

### Task chunk

{% comment %}

A step may require the user to perform several tasks - break those tasks down into chunks, allowing the user to scan quickly to find their place if they navigated away from this screen to perform the task. 
An example might be creating a personal access token for the action to use and then storing it in secrets 
For UI based tasks, include the button or options the users should click 
If the task adds code, include the code in context (don't just show `needs setup` show the entire `setup` and `dependent` jobs) 
{% endcomment %}

### Another task chunk

## Step 2: Do the next thing

{% comment %}

Rinse and repeat, adding steps and tasks until the tutorial is complete 
{% endcomment %}

## Next steps

{% comment %}

Provide a quick recap of what has been accomplished in the quick start as a means of transitioning to next steps. Include 2-3 actionable next steps that the user take after completing the quickstart. Always link to conceptual content on the feature or product. You can also link off to other related information on docs.github.com or in GitHub Skills.
